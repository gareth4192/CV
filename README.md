# Gareth McKenna

I am a hard working, enthusiastic junior developer seeking a challenging role that will make best use of my skills and allow me to develop them further.


## Skills

#### Problem Solving
My work in electrical installation was almost completely problem solving often requiring me to both find and solve the problem.
During university and whilst at makers academy there were many projects where problems arose almost a quickly as they were solved developing not only an ability to solve problems but an enjoyment in doing so.

#### Communication
During my role in electrical installation, my communication skills were tested and developed daily having to communicate with customers and colleagues as well as needing to liaise with other tradesmen working on the same site.
At university and makers academy i was often required to work in teams or pairs as well as taking part in twice daily stand ups, this developed my communications skills within a technical/agile environment.

#### Teamwork
Whilst at university i was often required to work in randomly selected teams, this helped me develop my teamwork skills to a point where i can adapt to and work with many different people.
A makers academy we worked in daily changing pairs, this required a lot of communication, teamwork and compromising skills.

#### Ability the learn on the go
At makers academy i worked with new topics weekly, this taught me how to learn quickly by developing my ability to pick up and work with new technologies.
